      <p>I'm an aspiring engineer with a penchant for the convoluted.  I'm also a pretty solid musician and punster if I do say so myself. 
        I wrote my first python programs at age 10, and have been screwing around with mechanics since I was 5 ish, trying to make machines out of legos.
        One day I hope to combine these passions and get into robotics, but robotics is expensive so it probably won't be anything impressive
        when I do.  Most of my programming experience has been game development, mainly because I can combine my musical and programming talents.
        I took a brief look into C and C++ for a break when I was entering High School, but still do most things in python.  
        I've been running linux as my main OS since 8th grade (I use arch BTW).  I have broken my system beyond repair at least 5 times, 
        and within repair many many more.  As is evident by this wonderful mess of a website, I also have experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
        I have little to no formal training in any of these things, so be warned if you start looking into my source code....
        <br><br>
        I plan to make this site a hub for all of the stuff I've made so that I can use it to scare college admissions officers and potential employers with.  
        Also I just wanted an excuse to try out web development.  For now it just kinda looks pretty.

      (You may be wondering what the green thing is.  It is called a flubadub, native to the fields around Amaru Village.  They have remarkably good camouflage 
      with the native prarie grass.  They are for external use only&mdash;if you ingest one please contact your local poison control center right away.  Symptoms
      may include nausea, coughing, diarhea, colorblindness, hallucinations, long-term memory improvement, and spontaneous combustion.)
