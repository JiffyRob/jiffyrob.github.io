      <p>I'm an aspiring engineer with a penchant for the convoluted.  I'm also a pretty solid musician and punster if I do say so myself. 
        I wrote my first python programs at age 10, the oldest of which being a program that asks for information like age and gender and 
        proceeds to insult you with it.  I have been screwing around with mechanics since I was 5 ish, trying to make machines out of legos.
        One day I hope to combine these passions and get into robotics, but robotics is expensive so it probably won't be anything impressive
        when I do.  Most of my programming experience has been game development, mainly because I can combine my musical and programming talents.
        I took a brief look into C and C++ for a break when I was entering High School.  I've been running linux as my main OS since 8th grade.
        I have broken my system beyond repair at least 5 times, and within repair many many more.  As is evident by this wonderful mess of a
        website, I also have experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I have little to no formal training in any of these things so I would
        stay away from the source code if I were you.
